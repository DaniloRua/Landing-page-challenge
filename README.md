# HORISEON Landing page

## The repository

This repository is where I performed the refactoring of a landing page as part of a challenge for the edX Web Development Front-End Bootcamp.

## Landing page

This landing page was created for the company HoriSEOn with the aim of highlighting the services offered and providing insights for potential clients.

## Code refactor

Refactoring in web development refers to the process of restructuring and improving the existing source code of a software system without changing its external behavior.
Main goals of code refactor:

- Readability 
- Code structure
- Accecibility
- Optimization 
- Bug fixing

Firstly, I started with semantic improvements. The previous version of this landing page was primarily constructed using the HTML element 'div'; I replaced it with elements such as Header, Main, Footer, etc., to enhance project readability.

Next, accessibility was implemented by using the 'alt' attribute, particularly for images. The 'alt' attribute provides alternative information for an image in case a user cannot view it due to reasons such as a slow connection, an error in the 'src' attribute, or if the user is employing a screen reader.

Another improvement was made to the CSS file, adhering to the Scout rule. This involved eliminating some duplicated properties and cleaning unnecessary lines of code.

Lastly, I included a README file to practice writing an informative README and to document what I have done for this challenge.
